## Description

This project is a fully functioning Google Books search engine that was originally built with a RESTful API and has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server. The app is built on the MERN stack:
- **MongoDB** for the database
- **Express.js** and **Node.js** for the back-end server
- **React** for the front-end user interface

Key features include:
- **Search**: Query the Google Books API for books.
- **Save Books**: Users can save their favorite book searches to the back end.
- **Authentication**: Secure sign up and login with authentication middleware adapted for GraphQL.
- **GraphQL API**: All data fetching and mutations are now handled via GraphQL queries and mutations, replacing the legacy RESTful API.

## Features

- **GraphQL Powered API**: Uses Apollo Server to execute queries and mutations.
- **User Authentication**: Modified middleware to support GraphQL authentication.
- **Apollo Provider Integration**: The React front-end is wrapped in an Apollo Provider so that all requests communicate seamlessly with the Apollo Server.
- **MERN Stack**: Built using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
